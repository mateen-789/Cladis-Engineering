    <h2>Marketing Team Overview</h2>
    <p>
      As the marketing team, our primary responsibility is to create a compelling and informative 1.5-minute video that highlights the crucial problem our product is designed to solve—helping disaster management teams locate and rescue humans and other living beings trapped in disaster zones. 
      The video serves as a powerful storytelling tool to demonstrate the gravity of these situations. We carefully select impactful news reports and real-life footage that showcase the challenges first responders face when trying to rescue victims who are buried or trapped under rubble after natural disasters, such as earthquakes or landslides. 
      These situations often make it difficult to locate survivors, and traditional methods may not always be effective. Our script ties these real-world issues with our innovative solution—a snake-like crawling robot that can move through debris-filled environments and identify trapped survivors. 
      By illustrating how our product addresses these challenges, we aim to highlight the immense value it brings to disaster recovery efforts. Through careful editing and thoughtful sequencing, we ensure that the video communicates a clear, engaging narrative that raises awareness about the problem, while also emphasizing the potential impact of our robot in saving lives and improving disaster management capabilities. 
      Additionally, we are responsible for preparing the PowerPoint presentation (PPT), ensuring it clearly and effectively conveys the core concepts and progress of our product, complementing both the video and the website.
      <br /><br />
      In addition to the video, we are developing a comprehensive website that serves as a detailed resource for our product. The website will provide an in-depth look at the research papers that inspired the design of our robot, showcasing the foundational knowledge that informed our approach. 
      It will also document the stages of prototype development, illustrating how the product has evolved over time through iterative improvements. Our goal is to present a clear, transparent overview of the product’s journey from concept to prototype, highlighting the technical advancements made during the development process. 
      To ensure that all of this content aligns with the robot’s actual capabilities, we maintain a close working relationship with the tech team. By collaborating with them, we ensure that the website’s content accurately reflects the current stage of development, from the design principles to the final product. 
      This close collaboration ensures that our marketing materials are consistently aligned with the latest technical developments, giving users, researchers, and potential partners a thorough understanding of the product’s potential and impact.<br /><br />
