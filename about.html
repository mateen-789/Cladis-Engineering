    <h2>Tech Team Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Meet our dedicated tech-team- <br />
        At Cladis Engineering, our technology team is passionate about learning and implementing our skills to address real-world issues. As a team of future engineers, programmers, and AI experts, we work together to design a robot for disaster relief. 
        <br /><br />
        Our lead project is a flexible, AI-powered snake-like robot capable of crawling through debris, sensing human life, and supporting rescue operations. It consists of advanced sensors, AI processing, and cloud-based data analysis. We are working on robotics, embedded systems, machine learning, and IoT solutions. 
        These help make our designs efficient and reliable even in harsh conditions and deep rubble. With natural disasters becoming more frequent and severe, we aim to design intelligent robotic systems that improve survival rates and revolutionize disaster management. 
        At Cladis Engineering, we don’t just build robots—we engineer solutions that save lives.

    <h2>Marketing Team Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Our role is to craft a compelling 1.5-minute video that highlights the critical problem our product addresses—locating and rescuing trapped individuals in disaster zones. Using real-life footage and news reports, we showcase the challenges faced by first responders in scenarios like earthquakes and landslides, where traditional rescue methods often fall short.
      <br /><br />
      We present our solution—a snake-inspired robot capable of navigating through debris to detect survivors—emphasizing its life-saving potential. The video combines storytelling, impactful visuals, and clear messaging to illustrate how our innovation supports disaster management.      
      <br /><br />
      In addition to the video, we’re developing a PowerPoint presentation and a detailed website. The website explores the research behind our design, documents the evolution of our prototypes, and highlights our technical progress. By working closely with the tech team, we ensure all content reflects the robot’s current capabilities, providing users, researchers, and stakeholders with a clear understanding of its impact and promise.
