    <p>Snake-Inspired Disaster Relief Robot</p>
  </section>

  <section class="intro">
    <h2>What if the key to saving lives in disasters wasn’t a person! but a robot that moves like a snake?</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine being trapped under rubble, with no way out and no rescuers able to reach you in time. In the chaos of collapsed buildings and disaster zones, traditional rescue methods often struggle to navigate through tight, unstable spaces. 
      That’s where innovation steps in.
      <br /><br />
      Meet the Snake-Like Disaster-Relief Robot ,designed to go where humans can’t. Inspired by the agility of snakes, this robot can slither through debris, squeeze into narrow gaps, and send real-time data back to rescue teams. 
      Equipped with advanced sensors, AI-driven navigation, and adaptive movement, it helps locate survivors faster and makes rescue operations safer and more efficient.
      <br />
      In moments where every second matters, technology becomes more than just innovation it becomes a lifeline. This is the future of disaster relief, built to save lives when it matters most.

      <h3>Three Cutting-Edge Prototypes</h3>
      <p>
        Development began with a 2D-axis motion prototype to validate fundamental locomotion capabilities. The second prototype incorporated both 2D-axis movement and real-time human detection, advancing the mobile robotics scope in constrained environments. The third prototype, currently in progress, aims to achieve autonomous, real-world 3D-axis serpentine motion across complex, debris-ridden terrains — a capability not yet realized at scale.</p>
    </article>
    <br />
    <article>
      <h3>Advanced Serpentine Motion with Complex Sinusoids</h3>
      <p>
        Inspired by snake locomotion, the robot employs complex sinusoidal waveforms to simulate natural serpentine motion. This design allows the robot to twist and bend with precision, enabling it to access narrow and obstructed pathways typical of post-disaster environments.

      <h3>Precision Phase-Difference Control</h3>
      <p>
        Realistic motion is accomplished via calibrated phase differences across multiple actuators. Rather than being hardcoded, the movement is an emergent behavior resulting from synchronized wave generation, achieved through iterative testing and motion control refinement.</p>
    </article>
    <br />
  
    <article>
      <h3>Advanced Multi-Pivot Control and Maneuverability</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike earlier models that allowed movement at a single twist point, this design introduces four degrees of freedom with individual joint control. The system supports omnidirectional navigation and increases adaptability on unstable terrain.</p>
    </article>
    <br />
    <article>
      <h3>Computer Vision–Driven Human Detection</h3>
      <p>
        Human detection is powered by a wireless video feed from a WiFi-enabled device, transmitted to a central server running a deep learning–based vision pipeline. Trained with self-supervised methods and augmented data, the model delivers robust recognition under varying lighting and occlusion conditions. Alerts are issued in real-time with accompanying visual logs to support timely decision-making.

    <article>
      <h3>Three-Dimensional Locomotion Capability</h3>
      <p>
        The second prototype introduced Z-axis movement, surpassing conventional 2D crawler functionality. This vertical mobility enables the robot to adapt to fluctuating elevation levels found in collapsed or unstable areas.

    <article>
      <h3>Toward Full Autonomy</h3>
      <p>
        The third prototype targets full autonomy in motion and decision-making. Integrating robotics, AI, and complex sinusoidal navigation, this system represents a significant step forward in autonomous search-and-rescue robotics.

      <h3>Benchmarking Innovation</h3>
      <p>
        This generation of the disaster-relief robot establishes new benchmarks in motion control, artificial intelligence, and structural adaptability. The technology has evolved from simple pivot systems to an AI-enhanced, modular, snake-like rescue unit engineered for high-stakes, real-world deployment.
